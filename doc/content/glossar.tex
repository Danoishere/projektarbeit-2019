\rowcolor{gray} \textbf{Term}&
Explanation \\ 
\hline

\textbf{Agent}&
An agent is the entity that needs to take a decision, based on its current situation. In this work, an agent usually corresponds with a train.\\
\hline

\textbf{AICrowd}&
A crowdsourcing platform for competitions about machine learning \cite{aicrowd_startpage}. The Flatland challenge has been partly organized by AICrowd.\\ 
\hline

\textbf{Episode}&
The cycle of taking actions and receiving a new state until the environment has reached a terminal state. \\ 
\hline

\textbf{Entropy}&
A term for how much randomness can be expected from a variable \cite{entropy_shannon}.
For a single variable an entropy of 1 corresponds to complete randomness, and entropy of 0 corresponds to complete certainty.
Abbreviated as $\mathcal{H}$.\\ 
\hline

\textbf{Environment}&
A system for reinforcement learning agents to learn. In this work, an environment is usually a Flatland rail simulation.\\
\hline

\textbf{Hypertext Transfer Protocol}&
A stateless protocol to transfer data between different applications on the application layer. \\ \hline

\textbf{Observation}&
The information extracted from the environment needed to make a decision. Abbreviated as $\mathcal{s}$.\\ 
\hline

\textbf{Policy}&
The rules used to decide which action to take, based on a given state. Abbreviated as $\pi$.\\ 
\hline

\textbf{Reinforcement Learning}&
See: \ref{reinforcementlearning} \nameref{reinforcementlearning}.\\
\hline

\textbf{Reward}&
The scalar value an agent can receive in a reinforcement learning task. Positive for good actions, negative for bad ones.\\ 
\hline

\textbf{Worker}&
A process that repeatedly rolls out Flatland environments to create training experience for the reinforcement learning algorithm.\\
\hline

\textbf{ZLib}&
A Python module to compress and decompress data. \\ \hline
