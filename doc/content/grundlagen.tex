\section{Intro into reinforcement learning}\label{projektmanagement}
In recent years, major progress in reinforcement learning has been achieved.
In reinforcement learning, an agent $\mathcal{A}$ learns to perform a task by interacting with an environment $\mathcal{E}$.
If the agent does well, it receives positive reward from the environment, if it does something bad, there is no or negative reward. The goal of reinforcement learning algorithm is now to maximize the expected future reward $\mathbf{E}[\mathcal{R}_{t+1}+\mathcal{R}_{t+1}+\mathcal{R}_{t+1}+...|\mathcal{S}_{t}]$
Policy based reinforcement learning aims to aquire a policy $\pi$ that maximizes the received reward $\mathcal{R}$. This happens by selecting an action
