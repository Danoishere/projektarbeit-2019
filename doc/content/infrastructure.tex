\section{Infrastructure}\label{infrastructure}
We used various computers and servers to train our model. Most of the time was a test environment server of the ZHAW School of Engineering used
with 56 CPU cores and 721Gb memory in addition 3 Openstack machines with 8 CPU cores each. \\
The flatland environment was running on each cpu core and the results where sent to a webserver which updated the model and sent the new neuronal network weights back to the client. \\
The reason why we used CPU cores over GPU performance is that the reinforcement algorithm A3C which we used performs better on CPUs instead of GPUs. \\

\section{Used Software}\label{used_software}
%Python 3, Tensorboard, Keras, Cython
Towards the end we decided to convert our Python code into C code, to get a performance boost in training our model. Cython was used in this case.\\
