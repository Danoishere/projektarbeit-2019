\chapter{Results}\label{chap.resultate}
\section{Round 1}
Our submission for Flatland round 1 does not include all algorithmic improvements discussed in this work. None the less, we were able to achieve a significant improvement in performance compared to the baseline version from \cite{flatlandstephan}.
Our submission for round 1 contains the following components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Custom A3C implementation without experience replay buffer.
	\item Default TreeObsForRailEnv (in round 1, this was a numeric vector by default).
	\item Policy learned by curriculum learning.
	\item Distributed training over multiple processes on the same machine (no cross-machine distribution possible yet).
\end{itemize}
Using the performance evaluation system provided together with the Flatland environment, we reach the following performance metrics:




%Vergleich mit Stefan:
%He used the first version of Flatland to evaluate his models and got a total score of 24.7\% in a local evaluation.
%He trained his model with 2 to 10 agents with a field of view of 10*10.
